# Course Notes Q&A - AI Teaching Assistant with RAG

A web application that allows users to upload course notes (PDFs, slides, documents) and ask questions about them. The application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers with citations to the source material.

This application is designed for students, researchers, teaching assistants, and instructors who want to quickly find information in their course materials without having to manually search through multiple documents.

## ðŸš€ Latest Features

- **Ultra-fast Processing**: Optimized processing for small files (<15KB) with instant text extraction
- **Enhanced Table Extraction**: Improved DOCX processing to extract data from tables and structured content
- **Cancel Processing**: Ability to cancel document processing operations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error recovery
- **Streamlined Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with simplified token validation

## Features

- Upload and manage course notes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Ask questions about the content of your notes
- Get answers with citations to the source material
- View source material inline
- Support for follow-up questions (chat history aware)
- Admin features to re-index on new uploads and monitor quality

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your API keys (OpenAI, Pinecone, Cohere)
5. Initialize the database with a default admin user:
   ```
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```
   ./start.sh
   ```
   Or run the components separately:
   ```
   # Backend API
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   
   # Frontend UI
   streamlit run app/frontend/app.py
   
   # Admin Dashboard
   streamlit run app/frontend/admin_dashboard.py
   ```
